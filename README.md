History
-------

Originally, this game started out as a sort of clone of
[Futilitris](http://twinbeard.com/140_futilitris). I'd never actually played
Futilitris as Adobe had long since dropped Linux support by the time I heard of
it, but I'd seen a gif somewhere and thought it was a cool idea.

It started out as a PyGame learning project, so it was very buggy but was still
fun to play.

You're now looking at the Haxe port, which is a bit more polished and a lot
more playable (PyGame is a pain to install).
