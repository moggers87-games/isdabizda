Isdabizda
=========

This is my PyGame "learning" project.

It started out as a SimCity clone, but then I found
[Futilitris](http://twinbeard.com/140_futilitris) and thought that it would be
better to clone that as the game logic was simpler (meaning that I'd spend more
time learning Pygame).

Running
-------

Make sure PyGame is installed and run the following:

`python -m isdabizda`

Controls
--------

Hit the arrow keys to manipulate the current block. "q" or escape will quit the
game.
